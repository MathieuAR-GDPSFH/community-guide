# Texture Packs
By: priestytheplushie 

This guide will help you create your own Texture pack for Geometry Dash, This guide works for both normal Geometry Dash and your GDPS. This guide is updated for 2.11 and **NOT** 2.2

NOTE: You cannot "add" textures to the game (without a mod) but you can **replace** textures, This guide will only cover replacing files, not modding new textures in. 

**DISCLAIMER: Editing Geometry Dash textures can lead to strange, sometimes unexplained glitches or odd behavior, make sure to backup your files before attempting this!**

## How Geometry Dash Textures Work

Before we can get started making our own pack, we must first learn how RobTop made textures work in Geometry Dash. In Geometry Dash textures are stored on spritesheets, which is a giant image of a ton of textures on it, these spritesheets are accompanied with a .plist file that tells the game **where** the textures are on the spritesheet. The android and second PC method in this guide do **NOT** touch the .plist files, while the first pc method does. Keep this information in mind while making your pack

## Methods

There are 3 different methods you can use to make your Texture pack, there is the**mobile** method, the **Replacement** method, and the **Texture Split** method. Each method has different pros and cons. 

## Mobile Method (Android)

This method is for GDPS owners who manage their GDPS on mobile, You can use the PC method to make packs for your Mobile device, so this method is **only** required if you mamage your GDPS on your mobile device.

NOTE: The default Geometry Dash APK cannot run "High" or UHD (Ultra High Detail) textures, you should edit the HD/Default files instead

You will need:

- Your GDPS Apk
- APK Editor
- Photo Editor
- Basic Photo Editing Skills

### Pros/Cons of this Method


| Pros  | Cons |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Can be done on mobile  | Limited to HD or Low graphics  |
| Simpler to understand  | More limited  |

### Step 1. Locating Files

Open your APK Editor and find your GDPS's APK, and choose "Simple Edit" than go to the Assats folder and save all the spritesheets you want to edit. 

### Step 2. Making your Pack

Now, open your photo editing app and start making your pack, you can make any kind of pack you want but you should note these things while making it 

- When you modify a texture, make the modifed texture the same size or slightly smaller than the original. It **cannot** be bigger than the origianl or issues will arrise
- When deleting the old texture make sure to delete **all** of the pixels, otherwise graphical errors may occur
- Use Black and Clear on icons if you want them to use the primary/secondary color of the player, or you can make a custom icon with custom colors that overrides the players colors
- Do not edit the logo with this method, instead use the Texture Splitter method for a better result.
- Make sure the file names of the spritesheets remain unchanged, otherwise the game won't recognize them.

### Step 3. Compiling the APK

Now,take your conpleted textures back to the APK Editor, go back to the GDPS Apk and open it in Simple Edit, than go to the assats folder, Click the "Replace" button and replace the old files with the new ones you just made, than press build

And now your done! install the apk and open it up to see your bramd new pack! 

## Replacement Method (PC)

This is basically the mobile method, but for PC. 

You will need:

### Pros/Cons

### Step 1. Locating Files

### Step 2. Make your Pack

Now, make your pack, you can make whatever you want, but make sure to follow these guidelines

- Make sure the textures are smaller or the exact same size, otherwise it will be cut off
- When deleting the old textures, make sure to delete everything
- Use black and white to make your icons change depending on the players selected primary and secondary colors in game

### Step 2. Splitting the Files

Now, open up the Texture Splitter and split the files, make the target the files that you want to edit and the location the "Textures" folder you made, you will have to do this once per spritesheet 

### Step 3. Make the pack

Now, make the pack, you can edit each texture individually and you don't have to worry about textures being too big! Heres some tips 

- Increase the canvas (paint.net) to allow you to make a bigger texture
- Make the textures however you want, there isn't many limitations

### Step 4. Merge the pack

Now, open Texture Splitter and merge all the spritesheet folders, if you get a popup about .plist files click "No" 

### Step 5. Save the pack 

Now, move the the files in the texture folder into the Resources folder (The spritesheets and .plist files ONLY) and than run the game, and your done! the texture pack should be open the game now!
