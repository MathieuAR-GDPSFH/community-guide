# An In-depth explanation of the PhpMyAdmin tables

### Tables: Tables in PhpMyAdmin have columns and indexes. An example of a table is the accounts table.
### Columns: Columns are columns in PhpMyAdmin tables that make the tables function for the server. An example of a column is accountID in the accounts table.

## Acccomments: This table displays all the account comments players have made on their profiles.
- userID: Tells you what user ID made the comment.
  
- Comment: Displays the content of the account comment. (it is encrypted though)
  
- Secret: Unused
  
- CommentID: Unique ID of the account comment.
  
- Timestamp: The unix timestamp. (basically when the comment was uploaded. You can use an online calculator to see the actual date and time.)
  
- Likes: displays how many likes it has. (A negative likes amount means dislikes.)
  
- isSpam: Shows if the comment has enough dislikes to be marked as spam

## Accounts: This table displays all the accounts in the GDPS.
  
- userName: Tells you the account's username it was registered with.
 
- password: Gives you password hash for the password of their account. (You can't decrypt this information, you can only use a website to check if the hash corresponds to text you type.)
  
- gjp2: Encrypted password hash
  
- email: Displays the email the account was registered with.

- accountID: Unique ID of the account. (useful when something in PhpMyAdmin asks for accountID.)

- isAdmin: This adds all permissions to your GDPS account.

- mS: This is the message state of the account. It doesn't appear to work though.

- frS: This is the friend request state of the account. It doesn't appear to work though.

- cS: This is the comment state(who to show your comment history to). It doesn't appear to work though.

  (2 = A succesful login into a account; 6 = When a user fails to login to their account. It can also be 6 because the user's account is disabled from failing to login 6 times;
  8 = When a level gets deleted off the servers; 9 = When a user updates their stats in-game; 16 = This is used for GJP verification every hour. It will only appear if sessionGrants is set to true in `config/security.php`)

- timestamp: the unix timestamp of when the action happened. ( You can use an online calculator to tell you when it was exactly.)

- value4: Similar to the other value columns, also for one type of action. (9 = This displays the amount of user coins the user collected.)
  
- value5: Similar to the other value columns, also for one type of action. (9 = This displays the amount of diamonds the user collected.)
  
- value6: This is for a 2.2 item. (9 = This will display the amount of moons the user has collected.)
  
- account: This is for action type 9. This displays the user ID of the user who changed their stats.

  (Note: When I put numbers such as "2 =" I was referring to the action type number 2.)

# Examples of using a table.

An example with using a table and its columns would be this:

Roles table: Click insert, set the permissions to 1 or 0, set the name and set the unique ID. Now click go.

Now go to the roleassign table: click insert, set the unique assign ID, put in the account ID you want to assign the role to and now put the ID of the role you are going to assign.

Now click go at the bottom of the site.

I hope this guide helped you to understand PhpMyAdmin better.
### Extra Information:

If someone tells you to login to PMA, that means you must login to PhpMyAdmin.

You do not need to know PHP to use PhpMyAdmin.
