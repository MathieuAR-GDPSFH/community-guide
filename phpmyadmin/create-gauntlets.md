  There isn't really a tools page to help you create a gauntlet,
  so this will guide you through creating a gauntlet via phpMyAdmin.

# Create gauntlets with phpMyAdmin

1. Open phpMyAdmin & login
2. Select the database starting with "gdps_"
3. Look for "gauntlets"
4. Open the insert tab
5. Fill in these things:
    * ID: This is the gauntlet ID. (1: fire, 2: ice, 3: poison, ...)
    * level1-5: These are the level IDs. (note: they will not appear in the order you put them in GD, they will appear in difficulty order)
6. Click on "Go"

If you're confused, here's a video:
