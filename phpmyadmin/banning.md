  Some users take things too far, and need to be banned. This is how you can IP ban a user. 
  WARNING: IP bans are circumventable. Please take extreme caution.

# Ban users with phpMyAdmin

1. Log into phpMyAdmin (GDPS Management -> GDPS Links -> phpMyAdmin)

2. Once you're in, you should see a lot of things. Just click on the button that is circled in the image below:

3. A lot of things should appear on the sidebar. Just find `users` and click on it

4. There should be a table of all of your GDPS's users. Look for the username of the person you'd like to ban. Let's assume I want to ban xavvvv (what did I ever do?)

5. As shown by my amazing highlighting, focus on the row with that person's username on it.

6. Use the scrollbar at the bottom of the screen to scroll to the other end of the page.

7. You should see their IP somewhere on that row; copy it, we're going to need it in a moment. Also, try not to leak everyone's IP. It's not nice.

8. You are now done in the `users` section. *loud confetti noises* Now, let's move on. Focus on the sidebar for a minute and find `bannedips`. Click on it.

9. You should see this screen; Click on the `Insert` button at the top of your screen (the button that is circled)

10. There should be a table. Find the IP row and edit the value. It *should* already say `127.0.0.1`. Delete it and paste in the user's IP but **don't** press `ENTER` once you're done. Just click onto the text box underneath (ID).

11. Next, you'll need to find the user's ID. You can find this by going to their profile in your GDPS and looking at the bottom of the window.

12. Paste it into the textbox and press Go.

You should now be done! Feel free to repeat the process for as many people as you want. Thanks for reading, I hope I helped! :)
