# Reuploading a level returns Error 1005

This error is because **GDPSFH's IP has been blocked** for downloading levels form RobTop's server and thus levels cannot be re-uploaded through the GDPS Tools page.

## Current Alternatives (only on PC)

You can transfer levels from one save to another using the GDShare mod, or copy the CCLocalLevels.dat file from your GeometryDash save folder located inside \`%localappdata%\GeometryDash\` to another save folder. If your GDPS' exe is called CoolGDPS.exe for example, you'll find its save folder inside \`%localappdata%\CoolGDPS\`. Please make sure to create a backup before replacing your save file.

## Future Alternative

The GDPSFH Panel has a page that allows the GDPS owner to reupload levels through a different method, however due to a bug in the code, it's currently disabled.
