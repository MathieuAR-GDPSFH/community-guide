# How to login to FTP

Use the same username and password as phpMyAdmin, these can be found under "GDPS Management".\
Copy the hostname and port. Use a FTP client such as FileZilla for Windows or CX File Explorer for Android.\
Paste the relevant credentials to connect to the server. If you're prompted that the connection may be insecure, ignore it and proceed.

Once you have connected properly you should see a few folders. One of which is named "httpdocs", there you can find the GDPS files.
